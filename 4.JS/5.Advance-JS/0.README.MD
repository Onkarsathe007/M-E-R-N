# 📘 Understanding JavaScript: Synchronous & Asynchronous Behavior

## 🚀 JavaScript: Single-Threaded and Synchronous by Nature  

- JavaScript runs on a **single-threaded** model, meaning it has **one thread** of execution.  
- By default, JavaScript is **synchronous**, meaning code executes **line by line**, **one statement at a time** in the order it appears.

### 🔍 Example of Synchronous Code:
```javascript
console.log("Start");
console.log("Middle");
console.log("End");

### To overcome this we use :
- promises()
- async and await keywords
